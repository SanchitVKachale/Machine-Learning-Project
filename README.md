# Machine-Learning-Project
Myself Sanchit Vaibhav Kachale. Learned and tried Machine Learning with Python for 1st time.
Project:- Stock Movement Analysis Based on Social Media Sentiment.
In this project, our aim is to scrape data from a social media platform and analyse its sentiment & predict stock movements.
I have used Reddit platform, where we can scrape data through PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper).
Sentiments are derived into Negative, Positive & Neutral categories.
Built model using Random Forest Classifier Algorithm which works on non-linear data effictively.
First, we train the model with some amount of data and then we backtest it with more ammount of data to check prediction percentage.

Setup requirements:- 
1)Python
2)Jupyter Notebook
3)Reddit Developer Account
4)Import python libraries such as numpy, pandas, yfinance, nltk, seaborn, IPython, pprint, matplotlib.pyplot before executing the code.
